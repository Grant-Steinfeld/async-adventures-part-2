## Prerequisites

### Minishift is the developers best option to run RedHat's OpenShift on a local developement workstation.
### What is ?  This is the Red Hat Container Development Kit - aka the developers

### Essentially this is - Kubernetes 
#### We chose a development environment on a [Mac laptop](./setup-local-env/minishift-mac-setup.md) 

This setup could also be done on a linux VM/laptop or a Windows PC
[read more how to here](https://docs.okd.io/latest/minishift/getting-started/setting-up-virtualization-environment.html) from the official docs.


Red Hat Container Development Kit provides a pre-built Container Development Environment based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux to help you develop container-based applications quickly. The containers you build can be easily deployed on any Red Hat container host or platform, including: Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host, and our platform-as-a-service solution, OpenShift Container Platform 3.
